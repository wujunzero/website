  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

abstract = {The objective of the diversified top-k clique (DTKC) search problem is to find k maximal cliques that cover the maximum number of vertices in a given graph. This problem is equivalent to the well-known maximum clique problem (MaxClique) when k=1. This paper proves the NP-hardness of the DTKC search problem and presents a local search algorithm, named TOPKLS, based on two novel strategies for the DTKC search problem. The first strategy is called enhanced configuration checking (ECC), which is a new variant of a recent effective strategy called configuration checking (CC), for reducing cycling in the local search and improving the diversity of the DTKC search problem. The second strategy is a heuristic to estimate the quality of each maximal clique. Experiments demonstrate that TOPKLS outperforms the existing algorithms on large sparse graphs from real-world applications.}

The diversified top-k weight clique search problem aims to search k maximal cliques that can cover the maximum weight in a vertex weighted graph. In this work, we propose a novel local search algorithm called TOPKWCLQ for the DTKWC search problem which mainly includes two strategies. First, a restart strategy is adopted, which repeated the construction and updating processes of the maximal weight clique set. Second, a scoring heuristic is designed by giving different priorities for maximal weight cliques in candidate set. Meanwhile, a constraint model of the DTKWC search problem is constructed such that the research concerns can be evaluated. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm TOPKWCLQ outperforms than the comparison algorithm on large-scale real-world graphs.},

  abstract = {Combinatorial auction is an important type of market mechanism, which can help bidders to bid on the combination of items more efficiently. The winner determination problem (WDP) is one of the most challenging research topics on the combinatorial auction, which has been proven to be NP-hard. It has more attention from researchers in recent years and has a wide range of real-world applications. To solve the winner determination problem effectively, this paper proposes a hybrid ant colony algorithm called DHS-ACO, which combines an effective local search for exploitation and an ant colony algorithm for exploration, with two effective strategies. One is a hash tabu search strategy adopted to reduce the cycling problem in the local search procedure. Another is a deep scoring strategy which is introduced to consider the profound effects of the local operators. The experimental results on a broad range of benchmarks show that DHS-ACO outperforms the existing algorithms.}
